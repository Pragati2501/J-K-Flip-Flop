# J-K-Flip-Flop
* A flip flop is a sequential digital electronics circuit having 2 stable state that can be used to store 1 bit of binary data. Flip flops are fundamental building blocks of all memory devices. There are many types of flip flops. One such flip flop is JK flip flop.
* J K flip flop is similar to SR flip flop but an extra onnection from outputs Q and Q' is done to eliminate invalid conditions as in the case of RS flip flop.

## Toolchain
* Xilinx ISE for synthesis
* Isim for simulation
